                What is an NPC? The liberal-bashing meme sweeping social media ahead of the US midterms
            </h3>
            <p class="quicknewsbody" lang="en">
                Twitter has suspended more than 1,500 spoof accounts featuring grey,
                expressionless avatars known as “NPCs”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each one takes a character known as “NPC Wojak” for their profile picture
                - carefully modifying his appearance to incorporate a rainbow Mohawk,
                hipster beard or tortoiseshell glasses - and tweets bland,
                politically correct pronouncements such as “Diversity is our strength!”

                But what is it all about? What is an “NPC” and why was Twitter
                so quick to shut down such apparently harmless fun?

            <p class="quicknewsbody" lang="en">
                The Internet has a strange relationship with Peppa Pig, a globally popular British
                children’s animated TV series about an anthropomorphic pig and her friends and family.
                In addition to the memes and a mix of subversive and sexually explicit parodies
                and remixes featuring Peppa, the character's popularity has been exploited through
                a series of algorithm gaming systems that generated a slew of fake Peppa Pig videos
                to garner views from children on YouTube.

                Well, it seems that Douyin, one of China's largest video-sharing platforms, has had enough.
                Over the weekend, tens of thousands of images and videos featuring the British television
                cartoon pig were scrubbed from the platform, leaving users to wonder what happened.

                    gently singing 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds' and a deep, affable,

                    A way out west there was a fella,
                    fella I want to tell you about, fella
                    by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
                    least, that was the handle his lovin'
                    parents gave him, but he never had
                    much use for it himself.  This
                    Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
                    Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
                    self-apply where I come from.  But
                    then, there was a lot about the Dude
                    that didn't make a whole lot of sense
                    to me.  And a lot about where he
                    lived, like- wise.  But then again,
                    maybe that's why I found the place
